# Week3HomeWorkSD
 So one thing that I am starting to quickly learn is that no matter how long you think its going to take double or even tripple the ammount of time. Im very bummed at how this is not a fully bug free and working product. And i know im close! But the debugging process at this point has taken longer then it did to write the code. And I need to turn somthing in and this is better then nothing. This is my second time coding this because the first time was a total bust and it got more buggy then I knew what to do and ended up just completely starting over (with the script file). 
 
 ## How It Works
  Its supposed to work in the fact that you have the slider at the bototm and you can slide left to right from a range of 1 - 20 and then checkboxes below that to select the complexity of that. But after trying and trying again. It displays something to the screen. It has a structure to it and I dont like that, as well as you will see it has some  "," after every letter and thats because I cannot figure out yet, how to work with arrays and objects. So frustrating.... But if look through the code i have left lots of notes along with lots of console logs in the code just commented out so you can also see how its breaking. I had it at one point where it worked flawlessly but only in the console.log(). Then When i tried to get it to display on the webpage thats when everything broke haha.
  
  Here is what the webpage looks like:
